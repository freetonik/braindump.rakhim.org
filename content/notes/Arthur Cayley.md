Arthur Cayley ([Mathematics]({{< ref "Mathematics" >}})) (16 August 1821 – 26 January 1895) was a prolific [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland) [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician) who worked mostly on algebra. He helped found the modern British school of [pure mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics).

He postulated the [Cayley–Hamilton theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Hamilton_theorem) —that every [square matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix) is a root of its own [characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial), and verified it for matrices of order 2 and 3.[(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley#cite_note-1) He was the first to define the concept of a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)) in the modern way—as a set with a [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_function) operation satisfying certain laws.[(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley#cite_note-2) Formerly, when mathematicians spoke of "groups", they had meant [permutation groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group). [Cayley tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_table) and [Cayley graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph) as well as [Cayley's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%27s_theorem) are named in honour of Cayley.

He was the first to coin the mathematical idea of 1/ “finite group” (1854) and 2/ “tree” (1857).

Name "tree" for the data structure in Math/CS was coined by Arthur Cayley in 1857 ([Tree (graph theory) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)))

Cayley was into representing mathematical forms graphically.

He was also perhaps the first to perform diagrammatic algebra [1]. He performed a graphical tree algebra on the very first paper he introduced the concept of “trees” in 1857.
