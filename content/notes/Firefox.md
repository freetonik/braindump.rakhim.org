 ## Tweaks
It's significantly better (I would say on par with Chrome) if you set general.smoothScroll.msdPhysics to true in about:config. No one seems to talk about it but the difference is like night and day on my system. No clue why it's not on by default.
Also using Wayland (on Linux), gfx.webrender.all and a few other options can help quite a lot. For more details, I suggest you check out these two pages:
