Here are some fonts (typefaces) I've found interesting.

- [Go fonts - The Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/go-fonts). Including serif monospace.
- [be5invis/Iosevka: Slender typeface for code, from code.](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)
- [source-foundry/Hack: A typeface designed for source code](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack)
- [Input: Fonts for Code](https://input.fontbureau.com/)
