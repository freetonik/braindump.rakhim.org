## History of Lisp
John McCarthy Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Stanford University
12 February 1979

>This paper concentrates on the development of the basic ideas and distin- guishes two periods - Summer 1956 through Summer 1958 when most of the key ideas were developed (some of which were implemented in the FOR- TRAN based FLPL), and Fall 1958 through 1962 when the programming language was implemented and applied to problems of artificial intelligence. After 1962, the development of LISP became multi-stranded, and diâ†µerent ideas were pursued in different places.
