I use Kindle for [Reading]({{< ref "Reading" >}}) books. I dislike its native delivery interface and prefer to manually download books via Calibre. I also keep it offline, but having it online has certain benefits. There are a few services that can deliver content to Kindle:

- [Omreader](https://omreader.co/). Blogs and newsletters via kindle.
