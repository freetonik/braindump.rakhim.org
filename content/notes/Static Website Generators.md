- A good way to use [Hugo]({{< ref "Hugo" >}}) is via [Emacs]({{< ref "Emacs" >}}) + [Org mode]({{< ref "Org mode" >}}) + [ox-hugo - Org to Hugo exporter](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/).
	- See the [relevant section of my config](https://github.com/freetonik/emacs-dotfiles#blogging-with-hugo)
- [The Idea Of Makefile Blog | Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/0skwhg/idea_makefile_blog)
	- [m4 is another wonderful little POSIX utility great for blogging](https://chrisman.github.io/9.html), and it ships with most Linux distributions by default. Phil Hagelberg’s entire site is [“published via GNU M4, rsync, and a 12-line Makefile.”](https://technomancy.us/colophon). If you’re into keeping it simple, this thing is definitely worth a look!
