title = "The Expression Problem"

The problem related to [Polymorphism]({{< ref "Polymorphism" >}}) known as “The Expression Problem” was first observed by John Reynolds in 1975. Philip Wadler, an American computer scientist known for his contributions to programming language design and type theory, has coined and explained the term as follows:

>The expression problem is a new name for an old problem. The goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases to the datatype and new functions over the datatype, without recompiling existing code, and while retaining static type safety (e.g., no casts).

FP/procedural langs: adding new operations is easy, adding new types is hard. OOP langs: the opposite
