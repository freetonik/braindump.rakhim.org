A video rant about desktop OS (mainly windows) and [Human-computer interaction]({{< ref "Human-computer interaction" >}}): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AItTqnTsVjA

- Typing a sentence has a flow. Windows UI has no flow, it's constant stops and resumes, like driving in downtown.
- Star Trek episode, ship needs to be restarted asap by putting hundreds of microchips in exact positions; only an android is capable of doing it. Windows UI is built for androids, not humans.
- It feels like the industry is trying to pull us back into the past when it comes to GUI
